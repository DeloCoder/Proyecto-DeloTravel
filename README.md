# Proyecto-DeloTravel
Repository containing code for DeloTravel self service console
This is my first proyect, it was done during my JS course in "CODERHOUSE.com" .
IÂ´ve learned (or tryied!) about HTML+CSS basic functions on my own, using tutorials on the internet, and then, during the course, about JavaScript, Git, and several other programs and technologies.
The main purpouse of the program is to create a Self Service ticket selling terminal. In this case, is intended just to 5 destinations and, for airplane tickets only
